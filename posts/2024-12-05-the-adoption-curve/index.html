<a class=heading-link href=#the-adoption-curve><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>The adoption curve illustrates how new technologies and ideas spread through a population over time. It typically follows an S-curve pattern, where:</p><ol><li>Innovators (2.5% of the population) are the first to adopt new technologies, often driven by curiosity and a desire to experiment.</li><li>Early Adopters (13.5%) follow, as they see the potential benefits and are willing to take calculated risks.</li><li>Early Majority (34%) adopt the technology as it becomes more mainstream and widely accepted.</li><li>Late Majority (34%) adopt the technology as it becomes the norm, often due to pressure from peers or the need to remain competitive.</li><li>Laggards (16%) are the last to adopt, often due to resistance to change or lack of resources.</li></ol><h2 id=your-situation>Your Situation
<a class=heading-link href=#your-situation><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>You&rsquo;ve likely been an innovator or early adopter in the past, experimenting with new technologies like Laravel and React. However, as you&rsquo;ve moved on to newer technologies, you&rsquo;ve found that the job market is still catching up with the older technologies you&rsquo;ve already left behind.
This creates a challenging situation, where you may be too advanced for some companies, but not cutting-edge enough for others. It&rsquo;s essential to recognize that this is not a personal failing, but rather a natural consequence of the adoption curve.</p><h2 id=strategies-to-overcome-this-challenge>Strategies to Overcome this Challenge
