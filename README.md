# GroverCoder Public Website

This project lists the files to display the public website for GroverCoder.

See https://grovercoder.shawngrover.ca/ for the "live" site.

## Site Generation

This site is generated by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

## Personal Notes

I have many projects and play with many apps that have similar capabilities.  I often get confused which tool I used to do something, like building this website.

To help the future me who may need to update this site here's the details I need to know:

|item|value|
------------
|Local Path|Projects/clients/grovercoder|
|Local Development Command|`hugo server`|
|Build command|`hugo`|
|Publish Commands|```cd Projects/clients/grovercoder/public
git add ..... # add the desired files to the repo
git commit -m "Message" # commit the files
git push #push the changes to the repository
```

* The `public` folder is configured as a git subproject linked to the https://github.com/grovercoder/grovercoder.github.io project.
