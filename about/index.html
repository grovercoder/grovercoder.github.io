Nestled just north of Calgary, Alberta, Canada, I have the privilege of seeing both the prairies and the mountains almost daily. This unique location allows me to appreciate the tranquility of nature while still being close enough to dive into the vibrant life of the big city.
My passion for creating spans from traditional woodworking to utilizing modern laser engravers, cutters, and 3D printers. I find great satisfaction in bringing ideas to life, especially through technology. Whether it&rsquo;s coding software for business solutions or crafting physical items, I revel in the process of making things work. Home improvement projects often catch my interest, and I occasionally dabble in art. Additionally, I enjoy playing the guitar, finding joy in the creative process, even if my guitar skills are more enthusiastic than expert.">

<p>My passion for creating spans from traditional woodworking to utilizing modern laser engravers, cutters, and 3D printers. I find great satisfaction in bringing ideas to life, especially through technology. Whether it&rsquo;s coding software for business solutions or crafting physical items, I revel in the process of making things work.

</h2>
<p>My career path has been anything but traditional. After serving in the Canadian Forces Reserves for eight years, I ventured into various roles in the private sector including network engineering and support, software development, project management, teaching, business management, and team leadership. While I have received post-secondary education, much of my technical expertise is self-taught or acquired through hands-on experience. This self-directed learning has often given me a depth and breadth of knowledge that rivals, and at times exceeds, formal education. In fact, some of the skills I mastered became standard curriculum only years after I had already learned them.</p>
<p>It has given me the flexibility to adapt and master new technologies quickly, often ahead of formal training programs.</p>
<p>I enjoy tackling complex projects, streamlining processes, and solving challenging problems. Whether collaborating with a team or managing projects independently, I’m committed to delivering exceptional results and ensuring success.</p>
<p>This has led to a specialized focus on developing systems that form the backbone of a business. From retrieving data and generating reports—whether using AI or custom logic—to building consumer-facing products, my work culminates in seamless solutions. Everything I create starts with a single command, whether it&rsquo;s scheduled for automation, triggered by a web action, or available on demand.</p>
